# Deep playground

Deep playground is an interactive visualization of machine learning concepts, written in
TypeScript using d3.js.

## Development

To run the visualization locally, run:

- `npm i` to install dependencies
- `npm run build` to compile the app and place it in the `dist/` directory
- `npm run serve` to serve from the `dist/` directory and open a page on your browser.
- `npm run serve-watch` to start an http server and automatically re-compile the TypeScript,
HTML and CSS files whenever they change.
